\section{Introduction}


\section{Program Design}
\subsection{Part 1 - Basic Booking Flow}
\subsubsection{Prompts and Variable Storage}
The program prompt user for guest name, number of guests, apartment ID, check in and check out date, length of stay and booking date. All of the input is validated such as the guest input can not be empty, number of guest must be integer. All of the Variables are stored and passes to the booking process. This has meet the rubic with clear message and minor limitation no consistency check between dates and length of stay 
\subsubsection{Data Types and Initialization}
The data type and inilization is clearly defined in the code base. Guest and point are stored in dictionary \textbf{picture}. Apartment and rates stored in dictionary \textbf{picture}. The program first initialize with the required data as assignment details (Alyssa (20), Luigi (32)) and three apartments with nightly rates. The program have implemented a good use of data type, only with the minor issue when using StorageManager, new guest are not auto-added
\subsubsection{Cost and Rewards Caculation}
The cost and reward caculation follow stricly based on the assignment details, cost = nightly rates x length of stay. Rewards = total cost rounded half-up to the nearest integer.
\subsubsection{Receipt Formatting}
The receipt prints all required details including guest, number of guest, apartment, rate, check in and check put date, nights, booking date, total cost and reward points. The format is clear and consistent with the assignment specification with AUD currency shown to 2 decimals
\subsubsection{Beyond Requirement Features}
The logging to file and stdout, storage manager with add/update/delete operations. Also there is a interactive booking loop 
\subsection{Part 2 - Menu \& Supplementary Items}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirement}
The program have shown a numbered menu and re-displays it after each task and implemented run\_once() a while loop menu. All of the options in the menu align closely with the spec's list including (1) Make a booking, (2) Add/Update apartment, (3) Add/Update supplementary items (bulk), (4) Display guests, (5) Display products. User now can make a booking flow with extended supplementary items can be added to their reciept. After an apartment is selected, the system offer supplementary items repeatedly until the user answer is no. Each Item capture thier ID and quantity, per-item cost = price x qty. The the supplementary subtotal is computed and shown in the receipt as required. The functional also include the update entries with aparment: one line apartment\_id rate capacity, validated against the U + digits + name pattern and applied as an upsert. Supplementary items can add a single item. In addition, a option to display existing data with guest, apartments and items information. The guest list will show each guest with accumulated points, aparment list will show each unit with rate and capacity and supplementary list showns each item with price.
\subsubsection{Data Structures}
For apartments, a dictionary is created with apartment\_id => {"rate": float, "capacity": int} initialised with U12swan (95.0, cap 2), U209duck (106.7, cap 2), U49goose (145.2, cap 2), matching the spec. Capacity default is 2 (explicitly stored), per spec.
For supplementary items a dictionary item\_id => price is initialised with car\_park (25), breakfast (21), toothpaste (5), extra\_bed (50)
For guest and reward points a dictionary guest\_name => points is initialised  with Alyssa (20), Luigi (32).
For orders history (beyond Part-2): mapping guest => [order\_summaries] that stores apartment, items, totals, and earned points.

\subsubsection{Input Validation}
The input validation stayed the same with part 1 mostly but there is a few changes. For numberic fields, the nights prompt the guest to select from 1 - 7 and Supplementary items: when ordering, item ID must exist. Any invalid invalid input leads the user to menu again and trigger the menu loop until the input is valided

\section*{Acknowledgment}

The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

\section*{References}

Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The 
sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference 
number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at 
the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers 
that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}. 
Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
element symbols.

For papers published in translation journals, please give the English 
citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
